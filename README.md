# Energy Analysis 2020
Analyzing the energy usage of New York during the Coronavirus Pandemic

In conclusion, I've come to learn that there has been a postive correlation between 2019 and 2020 demand with an overall drop in energy consumption starting January 2020. This can be seen in the plot "New York Demand 2020 vs 2019 - (Months of January to June)" below.
